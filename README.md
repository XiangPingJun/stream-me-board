## Installation

1. Install [firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart) for hosting the page on firebase
2. Init the firebase

```sh
firebase init
```

6. Create a file `static/firebase-conf.js` and fill your apiKey:

```javascript
firebase.initializeApp({
	apiKey: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
	authDomain: 'XXXXXXXXXX.firebaseapp.com',
	databaseURL: '//XXXXXXXXXX.firebaseio.com',
	storageBucket: '',
	messagingSenderId: '0000000000000'
})
```

7. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and run command:

```sh
npm install
```

## Build and run test
```sh
npm run start
```
Then you can test your page on http://localhost:8080

## Build and deploy

```sh
npm run build
# This will build the watch, stream, admin page

firebase deploy
# Upload the built page to firebase hosting, you can later view on firebase
```
